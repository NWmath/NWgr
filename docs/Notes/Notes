"CSR-like"
  incidence
  adjacency

"hypersparse"
  - another layer of indirection to efficiently look up neighbor lists and properties for non-contiguous vertex indices
  - outer range is map (or something associative) or we have an indirection
    - indirection is more efficient and is partitionable



// Raw data to incidence

// could have holes ("hypersparse")
template <range Vertex_t, range Edge_t>
auto make_index_incidence(const Vertex_t& V, const Edge_t& E);

// not have "holes" because vertices are implicit
//   indices don't mean anything, can't get vertex properties
template <range Edge_t>
auto make_index_incidence(const Edge_t& E);
